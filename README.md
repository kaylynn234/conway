# Conway
This is just a game of life implementation that I wrote in Rust in a couple hours. There isn't too much to say here.

## Usage
Clone the repository and run `cargo run`. Everything from there should be pretty self-explanatory.

## Why?
Somebody wrote an implementation that I disliked, so I decided to try my hand at one out of spite. I think I did pretty
well.
